## Overview

This project aims to develop a Medical Information Retrieval System for clinical decision support. The assignment consists of two phases: Phase A and Phase B. Phase A involves system development, while Phase B focuses on system evaluation using predefined datasets and metrics.

## System Description

### Phase A

In Phase A, we have implemented a Medical Information Retrieval System. The system features the following components:

- **Data Ingestion**: The system ingests a collection of medical documents, including metadata, abstracts, and full texts.
- **Indexing**: It creates an index for efficient retrieval, enabling users to search for medical information.
- **Query Processing**: The system processes user queries, identifies relevant documents, and ranks them based on relevance.
- **Retrieval Interface**: An interface allows users to input queries and retrieve relevant medical documents.

### Phase B

In Phase B, the system developed in Phase A is evaluated for its effectiveness in retrieving medical information. The evaluation process includes the following steps:

- **Data Collection**: We use the TREC 2014 collection, which includes medical topics, documents, and relevance judgments.
- **Automated Evaluation**: We have developed an automated evaluation system that calculates several metrics, including bpref, AveP', and nDCG', to assess the retrieval effectiveness.
- **Reporting**: The evaluation results are reported, including an analysis of which medical topics performed well and areas for improvement.


## Results

The results obtained from the Phase B evaluation are available in folder [\FinalCollectionIndex](\FinalCollectionIndexs)
